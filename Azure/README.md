# Azure Cloud Labs

## üå©Ô∏è Welcome to Azure Labs

This collection of hands-on Azure labs is designed to build your practical skills using both the Azure Portal and the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI). Each lab focuses on core Azure services and follows a structured approach to help you understand cloud concepts through direct experience.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, ensure you have:

1. **Azure Account**: Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
2. **Azure CLI**: Install and configure the Azure CLI using our [CLI Setup Guide](../CLI-Setup.md)
3. **Basic Knowledge**:
   - Familiarity with command-line operations
   - Understanding of basic networking concepts
   - Comfort with text editors for configuration files

## üîë Authentication Setup

For these labs, we recommend these authentication options:

1. **Interactive Login** (Simplest for beginners):
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
   This opens a browser window for authentication.

2. **Service Principal** (For automation scenarios):
   - Create a service principal with contributor role
   - Use the credentials for non-interactive authentication
   - Details covered in [LAB03-AzureAD-Roles-Users](./LAB03-AzureAD-Roles-Users/)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Follow the principle of least privilege in production environments. The broader permissions suggested here are for learning purposes only.

## üö∂ Learning Path

These labs are designed to be completed sequentially, as each builds upon skills from previous labs:

1. **Foundation** (Labs 1-3): Learn core compute, storage, and identity concepts
2. **Networking** (Labs 4-5): Build and scale application infrastructures
3. **Operations** (Labs 6-8): Master monitoring, databases, and advanced storage
4. **Advanced Services** (Labs 9-10): Implement DNS and serverless architectures

## üìù Lab Structure

Each lab follows a consistent format:

1. **Overview**: Introduction and learning objectives
2. **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of resources
3. **Portal Instructions**: Step-by-step UI-based guidance
4. **CLI Instructions**: Command-line alternatives for each step
5. **TODO Tasks**: Hands-on exercises to complete
6. **Validation**: How to verify your implementation
7. **Cleanup**: Instructions to remove resources and avoid charges

## üí∞ Cost Management

Most labs can be completed within the Azure Free Tier limits if you:

- Delete resource groups after completing each lab
- Utilize B-series VMs for cost optimization
- Monitor your cost analysis dashboard
- Set up budget alerts (covered in LAB06)

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Azure service status page
2. Verify your permissions and role assignments
3. Ensure your subscription has available quotas
4. Review NSG rules for connectivity problems
5. Check Azure Activity Logs for error information
