# GCP LAB08: Resource Overview ‚Äì Object Lifecycle Rules and Retention

## üîÅ What Resources Are We Working With?

In **GCP LAB08**, you‚Äôll learn to automate object storage policies in **Cloud Storage** using **lifecycle rules** and **retention policies**. These features reduce costs and enforce data governance.

## üìÇ Cloud Storage Bucket

### Description
Object-based storage ideal for files, backups, and static assets.

### Key Concepts
- **Storage Classes**: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive
- **Uniform vs Fine-grained ACLs**: Permission models for access control

### What You Do in the Lab
- Create a bucket and upload objects
- Choose storage class: Standard or Coldline

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lifecycle Management

### Description
Automates transitions and deletions of objects based on age or storage class.

### What You Do in the Lab
- Add rule: transition objects to Coldline after 30 days
- Add rule: delete objects after 90 days

---

## ‚è≥ Retention Policy

### Description
Locks data for a specified time, preventing deletion or overwriting.

### What You Do in the Lab
- Apply a 60-day retention policy to a bucket
- Attempt to delete an object before expiry (fails as expected)
