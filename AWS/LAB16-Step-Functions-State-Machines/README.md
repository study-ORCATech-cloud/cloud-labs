# AWS LAB16: Resource Overview ‚Äì AWS Step Functions State Machines

## üóÑÔ∏è What Resources Are We Working With?

In **AWS LAB16**, you'll explore **workflow orchestration and automation** using **AWS Step Functions**. This lab teaches you how to build and coordinate distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Step Functions allows you to create serverless workflows that stitch together various AWS services to build scalable, resilient applications without managing servers.

## üìä AWS Step Functions

### Description
AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps in a workflow.

### Key Concepts
- **State Machines**: Workflows that are made up of a series of steps or states
- **States**: Individual steps within a workflow that represent a task, choice, or other operation
- **Executions**: Instances of state machine workflows that are running or have completed
- **Input/Output Processing**: How data passes between states in a workflow
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms for retries, catch, and error handling
- **Express vs. Standard Workflows**: Different types of workflows optimized for different use cases

### What You Do in the Lab
- Create Step Functions state machines with various state types
- Coordinate AWS Lambda functions within a workflow
- Configure state transitions, error handling, and retry logic
- Monitor and debug state machine executions
- Implement parallel processing and choice-based logic
- Design workflows for serverless applications

## üîé State Types

### Description
Step Functions offers various state types that perform different functions within your workflows.

### Key Concepts
- **Task States**: Represent a single unit of work performed by a task (e.g., Lambda function)
- **Choice States**: Add branching logic to state machines based on input
- **Parallel States**: Execute branches of states concurrently
- **Map States**: Dynamically iterate over an array of items
- **Wait States**: Pause workflow execution for a specified time
- **Pass States**: Pass input to output with optional transformation
- **Succeed/Fail States**: End the execution successfully or with a failure

### What You Do in the Lab
- Implement different state types for various workflow requirements
- Configure state transitions and error handling
- Use choice states to create conditional logic
- Execute parallel processing using parallel states
- Iterate over data with map states

## üîç AWS Lambda Integration

### Description
AWS Step Functions integrates seamlessly with AWS Lambda, allowing you to build complex serverless workflows that combine stateless Lambda functions.

### Key Concepts
- **Function Invocation**: How Step Functions calls Lambda functions
- **Payload Transformation**: Converting data between Step Functions and Lambda formats
- **Error Handling**: Managing Lambda function failures within workflows
- **Retry Logic**: Configuring retry policies for Lambda invocations
- **State Machine Roles**: IAM roles that grant permissions to invoke Lambda functions

### What You Do in the Lab
- Create Lambda functions for workflow tasks
- Integrate Lambda functions into Step Functions state machines
- Configure input/output processing between Lambda and Step Functions
- Implement retry logic and error handling for Lambda functions
- Set up proper IAM permissions for service integration

---

## üîÑ Service Integration Patterns

### Description
Step Functions provides multiple ways to integrate with AWS services and coordinate complex workflows.

### Key Concepts
- **Request Response**: Call a service and move to the next state immediately
- **Run a Job**: Call a service, wait for completion, and then move to the next state
- **Wait for Callback**: Call a service and pause until a callback with a task token is received
- **Service Integration Optimizations**: Direct integrations with AWS services without Lambda

### What You Do in the Lab
- Implement various service integration patterns
- Coordinate long-running processes using Run a Job integration
- Configure direct integrations with AWS services
- Understand when to use each integration pattern
