# LAB01: Launch an EC2 Instance (AWS Console & CLI)

## üß† Lab Overview

Welcome to your first AWS hands-on lab! In this exercise, you will learn how to create a virtual server (EC2 instance) on AWS. You will perform the same operation using both the **AWS Management Console (UI)** and the **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**. This dual approach ensures you get comfortable with both manual and script-based cloud operations.

### üìö Core Concepts for Beginners
- **What is EC2?** EC2 stands for "Elastic Compute Cloud" - think of it as a computer in the cloud that you can rent by the hour
- **Virtual Machine vs. Physical Server**: Unlike physical servers that require hardware setup, virtual machines can be created in seconds through software
- **Cloud Computing Benefits**: Flexibility to scale up/down, pay only for what you use, and access from anywhere

## üåü Why EC2?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a foundational AWS service that lets you rent virtual servers on demand. It's commonly used to host websites, run applications, or perform general-purpose computing tasks.

### üí° Real-World Use Cases
- Hosting websites and web applications
- Running backend services for mobile apps
- Data processing and batch jobs
- Development and testing environments
- Running business applications like CRM or ERP systems

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand what EC2 is and why it's important
- Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Console
- Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI
- Understand key EC2 configuration components (AMI, instance type, key pair, security group)
- Connect to the instance using SSH
- Clean up by terminating the instance

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured (refer to the [CLI Setup Guide](../../CLI-Setup.md))
- A key pair for SSH access (you can create one during the lab)
- Basic terminal/SSH knowledge recommended

---

## üìù Part 1: Launch EC2 Using the AWS Console (UI)

1. **Login to AWS Console**: 
   - Visit [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and log in with your credentials
   - If this is your first time, you may see a welcome screen - you can skip the tour

2. **Navigate to EC2 Service**:
   - Type "EC2" in the search bar at the top of the console
   - Click on the "EC2" service that appears in the dropdown menu
   - Alternatively, click on "Services" in the top bar, then select "EC2" under the Compute section
   - You should now see the EC2 Dashboard

3. **Launch an Instance**:
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, look for a prominent orange button labeled "Launch Instance"
   - Click on the dropdown arrow next to it and select "Launch Instance"
   - This will take you to the instance creation wizard

4. **Configure Your Instance Step-by-Step**:
   
   a. **Name and Tag Your Instance**:
   - Enter `lab01-ui-instance` in the "Name" field
   - This name helps you identify your instance in the AWS Console

   b. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**:
   - Under "Application and OS Images", find "Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)"
   - Look for "Free tier eligible" tag to avoid charges
   - The AMI contains the operating system and initial software for your server
   
   c. **Select Instance Type**:
   - Under "Instance Type", select `t2.micro`
   - This is covered by the AWS Free Tier and provides 1 virtual CPU and 1 GB of memory
   - Note: If you don't see t2.micro, it might be called "t3.micro" or similar in your region - any "Free tier eligible" option is fine

   d. **Create or Select a Key Pair**:
   - Under "Key pair (login)", click "Create new key pair"
   - Key pair name: `lab01-key`
   - Key pair type: RSA
   - Private key file format: .pem (for Mac/Linux) or .ppk (for Windows with PuTTY)
   - Click "Create key pair"
   - The key will automatically download to your computer - **SAVE THIS FILE SECURELY!**
   - This key is the only way to access your instance; if lost, you won't be able to connect

   e. **Configure Network Settings**:
   - Click "Edit" under "Network settings"
   - VPC: Leave as default
   - Subnet: Leave as default (or choose any "Public subnet")
   - Auto-assign public IP: Enable
   - Create security group: Yes
   - Security group name: `lab01-sg`
   - Description: "Security group for Lab 01 EC2 instance"
   
   f. **Configure Security Group Rules**:
   - You should see one rule already added for SSH (port 22)
   - Change "Source type" to "My IP" (this restricts access to only your computer's IP address)
   - Description: "SSH access from my IP"
   - This restricts remote access to only your computer for security reasons

   g. **Configure Storage**:
   - Leave the default storage settings (typically 8 GB)
   - This is the virtual hard drive for your server

   h. **Advanced Details (Optional)**:
   - You can leave all advanced settings at their default values for this lab

5. **Review and Launch**:
   - Scroll down and review all your settings
   - Check for any warnings or errors
   - Click the "Launch instance" button at the bottom right
   - You'll see a confirmation page stating "Successfully initiated launch of instance"
   - Click on the instance ID link to go directly to your instance details

6. **Wait for the Instance to Start**:
   - In the Instances list, watch your instance's "Instance state" column
   - Initially, it will show "Pending" while AWS provisions your virtual server
   - After 1-2 minutes, it should change to "Running"
   - Wait until "Status check" shows "2/2 checks passed" (this might take a few more minutes)

7. **Access Instance Details**:
   - With your instance selected, look at the "Details" tab at the bottom
   - Find and note down the "Public IPv4 address" (e.g., 18.234.123.45)
   - This is the public address of your server on the internet

8. **Connect to Your Instance via SSH**:
   
   **For Mac/Linux Users**:
   - Open Terminal
   - Change permissions on your key file:
     ```bash
     chmod 400 ~/Downloads/lab01-key.pem
     ```
     (Adjust the path if your key is located elsewhere)
   - Connect with SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh -i ~/Downloads/lab01-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
     ```
     Replace YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP with the actual IP from step 7
   - If prompted with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting", type "yes"

   **For Windows Users**:
   - If using Windows PowerShell:
     ```
     ssh -i C:\path\to\lab01-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
     ```
   - If using PuTTY:
     1. Open PuTTY
     2. In the Host Name field, enter: `ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP`
     3. In the left navigation, go to Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials
     4. Click "Browse" and select your .ppk file
     5. Click "Open" to connect

   **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**:
   - If the connection times out, check:
     1. Is your instance "running" and passed status checks?
     2. Did you configure the security group to allow SSH from your IP?
     3. Are you using the correct key file and username?
   - If you see "Permission denied", check file permissions on your key (chmod 400)

9. **Explore Your Linux Server**:
   - Once connected, you'll see a welcome message and a command prompt
   - You are now connected to your EC2 instance!
   - Try these commands to explore:

   a. **Check system information**:
   ```bash
   uname -a                     # Display Linux system information
   cat /etc/os-release          # Check OS version details
   ```

   b. **Monitor system resources**:
   ```bash
   top                          # Show running processes and resource usage
   ```
   (Press 'q' to exit top)

   c. **Check network connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 amazon.com         # Test internet connectivity
   curl https://example.com     # Fetch a web page
   ```

   d. **View available disk space**:
   ```bash
   df -h                        # Show disk space usage
   ```

   e. **Create a file**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello from my EC2 instance" > hello.txt
   cat hello.txt
   ```

10. **Exit the SSH Session**:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

Congratulations! You've successfully launched and connected to an EC2 instance using the AWS Console!

## üíª Part 2: Launch EC2 Using AWS CLI

Now let's create another EC2 instance, but this time using command-line tools instead of the graphical interface.

### üìã Understanding AWS CLI

The AWS CLI allows you to control AWS services directly from your terminal. This is powerful for:
- Automation and scripting
- Faster operations once you're familiar with commands
- Reproducible infrastructure setups

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Steps

1. **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   - On Windows: Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
   - On Mac/Linux: Open Terminal

2. **Verify AWS CLI Installation**:
   ```bash
   aws --version
   ```
   You should see version information confirming the AWS CLI is installed

3. **Create a Security Group**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-security-group \
     --group-name lab01-cli-sg \
     --description "Security group for CLI lab"
   ```
   
   You should see output like:
   ```json
   {
       "GroupId": "sg-0123456789abcdef0"
   }
   ```
   
   Make note of this GroupId for future reference

4. **Allow SSH Access to Your Security Group**:

   a. **First, find your public IP address**:
   - Visit [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) or google "what is my ip"
   - Copy your IPv4 address (e.g., 203.0.113.0)

   b. **Add an inbound rule for SSH**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
     --group-name lab01-cli-sg \
     --protocol tcp \
     --port 22 \
     --cidr YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32
   ```
   
   Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual IP address, keeping the `/32` at the end
   
   Example: `--cidr 203.0.113.0/32`
   
   The `/32` means "this exact IP only" for security purposes

5. **Get the Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID**:

   Different regions have different AMI IDs. This command finds the right one for your region:
   
   ```bash
   aws ssm get-parameters-by-path \
     --path "/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest" \
     --query "Parameters[?Name=='/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2'].Value" \
     --output text
   ```
   
   You'll receive an AMI ID like: `ami-0123456789abcdef0`
   
   Save this ID for the next step

6. **List Available Key Pairs**:

   Let's see what key pairs are available in your account:
   
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-key-pairs
   ```
   
   You should see the `lab01-key` we created earlier. If not, you'll need to create a new key pair:
   
   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-key-pair \
     --key-name lab01-cli-key \
     --query "KeyMaterial" \
     --output text > lab01-cli-key.pem
   ```
   
   On Mac/Linux, make the key file private:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 lab01-cli-key.pem
   ```

7. **Launch an EC2 Instance**:

   Now we'll use all the pieces we've gathered to launch an instance:
   
   ```bash
   aws ec2 run-instances \
     --image-id ami-0123456789abcdef0 \
     --count 1 \
     --instance-type t2.micro \
     --key-name lab01-key \
     --security-groups lab01-cli-sg \
     --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=lab01-cli-instance}]'
   ```
   
   Replace:
   - `ami-0123456789abcdef0` with the AMI ID from step 5
   - `lab01-key` with your key pair name from step 6 (if different)
   
   You'll get a large JSON response with details about your new instance, including:
   - InstanceId (e.g., `i-0123456789abcdef0`)
   - State (should be `pending`)
   - Private and Public IP addresses (if assigned)
   
   Save the InstanceId for later use

8. **Wait for the Instance to Start Running**:

   Check the status of your instance:
   
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 \
     --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name" \
     --output text
   ```
   
   Replace `i-0123456789abcdef0` with your actual instance ID
   
   Wait until you see "running" as the output

9. **Get Your Instance's Public IP Address**:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 \
     --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].PublicIpAddress" \
     --output text
   ```
   
   Replace `i-0123456789abcdef0` with your actual instance ID
   
   This command will output just the public IP address of your instance

10. **Connect to Your Instance via SSH**:

    ```bash
    ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP
    ```
    
    Replace:
    - `path/to/your-key.pem` with the actual path to your key file
    - `PUBLIC_IP` with the IP address from step 9
    
    For example:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/Downloads/lab01-key.pem ec2-user@18.234.123.45
    ```

11. **Explore Your Instance**:

    Just like with the UI-created instance, try some Linux commands:
    
    ```bash
    # System info
    hostname
    whoami
    
    # Check available memory
    free -h
    
    # Check disk space
    df -h
    
    # View network interfaces
    ip addr show
    
    # Check running processes
    ps aux
    ```

12. **Exit SSH Connection**:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

Congratulations! You've now created an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI!

## üß™ Optional Challenge: Host a Simple Website

Let's turn your EC2 instance into a web server and host a simple HTML page. This demonstrates a common real-world use case for EC2.

1. **SSH Into Your Instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

2. **Install the Apache Web Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y                   # Update all packages
   sudo yum install -y httpd            # Install Apache
   sudo systemctl start httpd           # Start the web server
   sudo systemctl enable httpd          # Configure to start on boot
   ```

3. **Check Apache Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```
   You should see "active (running)" in the output

4. **Create a Simple Web Page**:
   ```bash
   echo "<html>
   <head><title>My EC2 Web Server</title></head>
   <body>
     <h1>Hello from EC2!</h1>
     <p>This page is being served from my Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
     <p>Current server time: $(date)</p>
   </body>
   </html>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
   ```

5. **Allow HTTP Traffic to Your Instance**:

   **For the Console-created instance**:
   - Go back to the AWS Console
   - Select your instance
   - Select the "Security" tab
   - Click on the Security Group link
   - Click "Edit inbound rules"
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Type: HTTP, Source: Anywhere-IPv4
   - Click "Save rules"

   **For the CLI-created instance**:
   
   From your local terminal (not the SSH session):
   ```bash
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
     --group-name lab01-cli-sg \
     --protocol tcp \
     --port 80 \
     --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   ```
   This allows web traffic (HTTP) from any IP address to reach your server

6. **Test Your Website**:
   - Open a web browser
   - Navigate to `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP` (not https)
   - You should see your "Hello from EC2!" web page

7. **Customize Your Web Page (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
   ```
   Use the nano text editor to make changes, then press CTRL+O to save and CTRL+X to exit

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't Connect to EC2

1. **Instance Not Running**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID \
     --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name" \
     --output text
   ```
   Ensure it shows "running"

2. **Security Group Issues**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
     --group-names lab01-cli-sg
   ```
   Check that port 22 is open to your IP address

3. **Key Pair Problems**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct key
   - Ensure proper permissions: `chmod 400 your-key.pem`
   - Try specifying the username explicitly: `ec2-user@YOUR_IP`

### Website Not Loading

1. **Apache Not Running**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```
   If not running: `sudo systemctl start httpd`

2. **Port 80 Not Open**:
   Check security group settings for HTTP (port 80) access

3. **Firewall Issues**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status firewalld
   ```
   If active, allow HTTP: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http`

---

## üåÄ Cleanup - IMPORTANT!

To avoid ongoing charges, let's terminate both instances:

1. **Find Your Instance IDs**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=lab01-ui-instance,lab01-cli-instance" \
     --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" \
     --output text
   ```

2. **Terminate the Instances**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 i-0abcdef1234567890
   ```
   Replace with your actual instance IDs

3. **Verify Termination**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids YOUR_INSTANCE_ID \
     --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].State.Name" \
     --output text
   ```
   Wait until you see "terminated"

4. **Delete Security Groups** (Once instances are terminated):
   ```bash
   aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-name lab01-cli-sg
   ```
   Repeat for any other security groups you created

5. **Check AWS Console**:
   - Go to EC2 Dashboard
   - Verify no instances are running
   - Check under Security Groups to ensure your lab groups are deleted
