# AWS Cloud Labs

## üå©Ô∏è Welcome to AWS Labs

This collection of hands-on AWS labs is designed to build your practical skills using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Each lab focuses on core AWS services and follows a structured approach to help you understand cloud concepts through direct experience.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting these labs, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account**: Create a [free tier AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
2. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI using our [CLI Setup Guide](../CLI-Setup.md)
3. **Basic Knowledge**:
   - Familiarity with command-line operations
   - Understanding of basic networking concepts
   - Comfort with text editors for configuration files

## üîë Authentication Setup

For these labs, we recommend creating an IAM user with programmatic access:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to IAM service
3. Create a new user with programmatic access
4. Attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy (for learning purposes only)
5. Save the access key ID and secret access key
6. Configure your AWS CLI with `aws configure`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: For production environments, always follow the principle of least privilege. The administrator access suggested here is for learning purposes only.

## üö∂ Learning Path

These labs are designed to be completed sequentially, as each builds upon skills from previous labs:

1. **Foundation** (Labs 1-3): Learn core compute, storage, and security concepts
2. **Networking** (Labs 4-5): Build and scale application infrastructures
3. **Operations** (Labs 6-8): Master monitoring, databases, and advanced storage
4. **Advanced Services** (Labs 9-10): Implement DNS and serverless architectures
5. **Advanced Applications** (Labs 11-20): Build sophisticated cloud solutions using multiple integrated services

## üìù Lab Structure

Each lab follows a consistent format:

1. **Overview**: Introduction and learning objectives
2. **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of resources
3. **Console Instructions**: Step-by-step UI-based guidance
4. **CLI Instructions**: Command-line alternatives for each step
5. **TODO Tasks**: Hands-on exercises to complete
6. **Validation**: How to verify your implementation
7. **Cleanup**: Instructions to remove resources and avoid charges

## üí∞ Cost Management

Most labs can be completed within the AWS Free Tier limits if you:

- Terminate EC2 instances after each lab
- Delete non-essential resources when finished
- Monitor your billing dashboard regularly
- Set up billing alerts (covered in LAB06)

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the AWS service status page
2. Verify your IAM permissions
3. Ensure your region is set correctly
4. Review security group rules for connectivity problems
5. Check the AWS documentation for service-specific troubleshooting
